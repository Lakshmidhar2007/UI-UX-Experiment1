# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:

To explore and understand the fundamentals of UI and UX design, differentiate between them through real-world case studies, analyze their interrelationship, and demonstrate the use of various UI/UX design tools for effective user-centered design.

## Algorithm:

1. Study the fundamentals and principles of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience).

2. Collect and analyze real-world case studies like Airbnb, Amazon, and Craigslist.

3. Identify UI aspects such as color, typography, and layout.

4. Examine UX processes like user research, personas, and usability testing.

5. Compare how UI and UX complement each other in improving user satisfaction.

6. Demonstrate tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch for prototyping.

7. Evaluate usability and accessibility to ensure an effective design outcome.
